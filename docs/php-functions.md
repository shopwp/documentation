# PHP Functions

These PHP functions allow you to programmatically fetch raw Shopify data.

## Things to know

Before using these functions, keep in mind ...

1. These functions will make a network request the first time they run. The payload will then be cached for any consecutive calls _only if the [ShopWP cache](/getting-started/displaying#caching) is enabled_.
2. If a cached payload is found, these functions will return the cached version insteadâ€”skipping the network request. If you notice the data is stale, make sure to clear the [ShopWP cache](/getting-started/displaying#caching).

## get_product()

Allows you to fetch a single product by `post_id`, `product_id`, or `storefront_id`.

You must pass one of the below keys to the `$params` argument:

```
post_id
product_id
storefront_id
```

Additional fields you can pass:

```
page_size
reverse
sort_by
schema
language
country
```

:::info
Note: If you pass the `schema` key, you can explicitly choose which product fields to return during the request. By default, all product fields will be returned. The full list of available fields can be [found here](https://shopify.dev/api/storefront/reference/products/product#fields-2021-10).

| Argument | Description               |
| :------- | :------------------------ |
| $params  | An array of query options |

**Example**:
Get product title and description by post id

```php
$Products = ShopWP\Factories\API\Items\Products_Factory::build();
$post_id = 16563; // required

$result = $Products->get_product([
   'post_id' => $post_id,
   'schema' => '
      title
      description
   '
]);
```

**Example**:
