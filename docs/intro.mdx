# Introduction

ShopWP is a premium WordPress plugin that enables you to display and sell [Shopify](https://shopify.pxf.io/5bPL0L) products on any WordPress site.

When using ShopWP, you can think of WordPress as the frontend and Shopify as the backend. All store management such as editing prices, changing product images, etc will occur inside Shopify. This data can then be shown in unique and powerful ways on WordPress.

Formerly known as ~~WP Shopify~~, ShopWP comes bundled with a ready-to-use <a href="#!" className="shopwp-cart-trigger">cart experience</a>. This cart is powered by JavaScript and "slides in" without any additional page loads. <a href="#!" className="shopwp-cart-trigger">Try it out!</a> When a customer is ready to checkout, ShopWP sends them to the default Shopify checkout page to place the order and provide the payment.
