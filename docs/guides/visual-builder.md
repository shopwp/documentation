# Visual Builder

ShopWP comes with a Visual Builder, allowing you to create product layouts while having a shortcode generated automatically. You can then use these shortcodes on any page you'd like.

You can create as many layouts as you want. Easily reference the shortcode on the listing page, or find it at the top of the shortcode edit screen.
