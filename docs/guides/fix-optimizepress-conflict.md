# Fix OptimizePress Conflict

If you're using the [OptimizePress](https://www.optimizepress.com) plugin, you'll need to ensure ShopWP is set to load when OptimizePress pages are rendered.

If you don't do this, your products may only display a message that says "Loading component...".

## Open your OptimizePress settings

First, go into WordPress and open your OptimizePress settings.

### Turn on ShopWP

Within the `Scripts And Styles` section, ensure ShopWP is enabled for both the Frontend and Backend. Choose both the JS and CSS checkboxes.

Once you click save, your products should load.
