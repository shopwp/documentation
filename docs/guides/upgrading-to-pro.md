# Upgrading to ShopWP Pro

Before we get started, keep in mind that ShopWP and ShopWP Pro are _separate_, independent plugins. You'll want to use one or the other.

:::info
The upgrade process will _not_ remove any content you may have added, including synced product posts, updated settings, etc.

### 1. Purchase a License Key

The first step is to purchase a license key. You can do this by [visiting our purchase page](https://wpshop.io/purchase).
