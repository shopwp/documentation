# Introduction

ShopWP is a WordPress plugin that integrates Shopify into any WordPress site. 

When using ShopWP, you can think of WordPress as the frontend and Shopify as the backend. All store management such as editing prices, changing product images, etc happens inside Shopify. This data can then be shown in unique and powerful ways on WordPress.

Formerly known as ~~WP Shopify~~, ShopWP comes in two versions; a [free version](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpshopify/) and a [Pro version](https://wpshop.io/purchase/).

Both versions come bundled with a ready-to-use cart experience. This cart is powered by JavaScript and "slides in" to view without needing additional page loads. When a user is ready to checkout, they're redirected to the default Shopify checkout page to place the order. You can see a demo of the [built-in cart here](https://wpshop.io/features).

Displaying your products and collections is the most powerful feature of ShopWP. The plugin provides 10+ Shortcodes, Gutenberg Blocks, Elementor and Beaver Builder extensions, and tons of customization flexibility.
