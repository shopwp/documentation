# URL Params

ShopWP allows you to control various functionality of the plugin through useful URL params.

## ?discount=

The `discount` URL param allows you to auto apply a discount to the ShopWP cart on page load. The discount needs to exist inside Shopify already.

```php
https://yoursite.com?discount=20PERCENT
```

## ?variant=

The `variant` URL param allows you to auto select a product variant on page load. You can use it like this:

```php
https://yoursite.com?variant=44069737332902
```
