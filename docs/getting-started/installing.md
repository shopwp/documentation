# Installing

:::caution

Before you can use ShopWP you must already have an active Shopify store. The plugin is compatible with any Shopify plan including [14-day free trials](https://www.shopify.com/?ref=wps) and the more affordable $9 [Lite plan](https://www.shopify.com/lite).

:::

As mentioned in the introduction, ShopWP comes in two versions; a [free version](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpshopify/) and a [Pro version](https://wpshop.io/purchase/). They are two seperate plugins and only one should be activated at any given time. Installing is like any other WordPress plugin, but there are some specific steps that need to be taken for the Pro version. If you're upgrading from free to Pro please read the [Upgrading](#upgrading) section.

We recommended the [Shopify Lite plan](https://www.shopify.com/lite) if you intend to only sell on WordPress and other sales channels such as Facebook or Instagram. All plugin features will work with Shopify Lite and is a great option if want to save money!

Okay, let's get started! ðŸ™Œ

## Installing the free version

### 4. Activate your license key

After installing and activating the plugin, you'll need to activate your license key.

Begin by finding your license key. It should be listed in your ShopWP account under the `Licenses` tab. You can also find it on the payment confirmation screen as well as in the post purchase email.
