# Installing

ShopWP comes in two versions; a [free version](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpshopify/) and a [Pro version](https://wpshop.io/purchase/). _The free version is no longer maintained_. They are two separate plugins and only one should be activated at once.

:::caution
Before you can install any version of ShopWP, you must have an active Shopify store. The plugin is compatible with any [Shopify plan](https://shopify.pxf.io/b39yJv) including [14-day free trials](https://shopify.pxf.io/5bPL0L) _and_ the more affordable $9 [Lite plan](https://shopify.pxf.io/vnqbrj).

:::info
If you're upgrading from free to Pro, please read the [Upgrading](/guides/upgrading-to-pro) guide.

We recommended the [Shopify Lite plan](https://shopify.pxf.io/vnqbrj) if you intend to only sell on WordPress and other sales channels such as Facebook or Instagram. All plugin features will work with Shopify Lite and is a great option if want to save money!

Okay, let's get started! ðŸ™Œ
