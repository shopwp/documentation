# Syncing

Before we get into how to sync, it's important to understand what syncing means for ShopWP. 




Product and Collection Detail Pages are turned off by default. So before you can use them, you'll need to go through a couple steps to turn them on.

WP Shopify comes with two default pages: "WP Shopify Products" and "WP Shopify Collections". These two pages are created when the plugin is first installed. The purpose of these pages is to display a list of your products or collections.

However, if you do not wish to use these pages you can turn them off within the plugin settings. You can also choose a different page to be used instead.

Next, go back to WordPress and begin filling in the API credentials generated from the Private App. Once done, click "Connect your Shopify store".

The plugin should begin syncing your store data. Depending on how many products you have, the syncing process can take anywhere from 30 seconds to 10minutes. Once the syncing is finished you should see a "completed" message.

You're now ready to start showing your products.
