# ShopWP Pro License

When you purchase [ShopWP Pro](https://wpshop.io/purchase?utm_medium=docs&utm_source=license&utm_campaign=upgrade) you're given a single license key ðŸ”‘. This key gives you access to:

- Pro-only features
- Plugin updates
- Dedicated support (Slack channel)

:::info

To continue receiving access to the above features, you must have an **active** license key.

:::

If you purchased the [Standard plan](https://wpshop.io/purchase/), your license key can be added up to **three** WordPress sites. If you purchased the [Agency plan](https://wpshop.io/purchase/), your key can be added to an unlimited amount of sites.

## Finding your license key

Your license key is listed in your ShopWP account under the `Licenses` tab. You can also find it in the following places:

- Payment confirmation screen (after checkout)
- The post purchase email
