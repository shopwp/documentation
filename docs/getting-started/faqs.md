# FAQs

Below are some of the most commonly asked questions about ShopWP.

## Does ShopWP work with X app?

ShopWP does work with many Shopify apps—but not all of them. The apps that generally work are those that customize the backend or admin of the store. For example, an inventory or analytics app.

The apps that usually do _not_ work are those that customize the front-end of the store, such as bundle or variant apps with date pickers. This is because ShopWP creates it's own frontend on WordPress—bypassing the Shopify theme.

Your best bet is to install the app and simply check whether the functionality works as expected.

## What are the benefits of ShopWP vs X?

ShopWP provides a few major benefits over other Shopify / WordPress solutions:

1. Ability to sync products and collections which creates detail pages automatically for you.
2. Allows for customizing the visual style and functionality of products. For example, enabling an image zoom feature, direct checkout, selling subscription products etc.
3. Integrates with other WordPress plugins such as Yoast, ACF, Elementor, etc

One really annoying thing about the Shopify buy button is that it requires copying / pasting JavaScript code into the WordPress page. This might be fine for a one time embed. However if you need to change something about the layout, you'll need to regenerate the embed code and then copy / paste it again. This quickly becomes unmanageable when you want to embed different products on multiple pages.

Does this help?
